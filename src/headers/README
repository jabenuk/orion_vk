Directory information: /src/headers/
====================================

|--------------------------------------------|
| This file may not be representative of the |
| most up-to-date version of the repository! |

This directory holds internally-used header files. They are NOT to be
included by the user, and certainly not as part of the orion.h API
header.

The following file descriptions can be seen in the Doxygen @file
descriptors in the respective file (this is not built into the Doxygen
documentation).

orion_codes.h:
    This file declares standardised macros for things commonly
    referenced in the Orion library - mostly errors.

orion_funcs.h:
    This file declares all internal functions - not specifically
    'helper' functions, as those are declared in orion_helpers.h.

orion_helpers.h:
    This file declares functions and macros that are widely used
    within the internal scope of the Orion library - normally to reduce
    code reuse and improve readability and therefore maintainability.

orion_structs.h:
    This file defines the members of public, but opaque, library
    structures.

    As these structures are widely referred to throughout the library,
    their definitions have been merged into this one header file as
    opposed to, for example, defining a 'buffer' struct in some sort
    of 'buffer.c' source file (in that case, it could only be directly
    modified in said 'buffer.c' file).
