Directory information: /src/vulkan/
===================================

|--------------------------------------------|
| This file may not be representative of the |
| most up-to-date version of the repository! |
|--------------------------------------------|

This directory holds source files that define public API functions that
are either Vulkan abstractions or functions related to the Vulkan API.

The following file descriptions can be seen in the Doxygen @file
descriptors in the respective file (this is not built into the Doxygen
documentation).

vk_debug.c:
    This file defines functions involved with debugging Vulkan.

    Most of these functions require VK_EXT_debug_utils or similar extensions
    to be enabled.

vk_extension.c:
    This file contains functions broadly related to the use of Vulkan API
    features.

    This isn't specifically extensions, but rather instance + device
    extensions as well as layers and anything else Vulkan-related that
    isn't in the Core API.

vk_init.c:
    This file defines functions involved with loading, initialising, and
    managing the Vulkan interface with the use of Orion abstractions.
