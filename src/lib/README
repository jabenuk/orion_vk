Directory information: /src/lib/
================================

|--------------------------------------------|
| This file may not be representative of the |

This directory holds source files that define public API functions that
are related to the Orion library. Internal functions are also defined
within these files.

The following file descriptions can be seen in the Doxygen @file
descriptors in the respective file (this is not built into the Doxygen
documentation).

callback.c:
    This file contains definitions for callbacks used both internally
    within the Orion library and as default options for user-set callbacks.

error.c:
    This file contains functions related to error handling.

    It should be noted that this mostly refers to library debugging -
    that is to say, debugging aspects of the Orion library rather than
    the Vulkan API specifically. Although some functionality related to
    Vulkan debugging is indeed located in this file, this is generally
    when it is directly tied to creation of state or other library features.

init.c:
    This file defines functions involved with:
      - 'initialising' the library (i.e. creating a state object)
      - the creation of some core library structures
      - the overall termination of the library
      - configuring the library
