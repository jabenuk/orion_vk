#
# This GitHub workflow is here to automate the deployment of
# Orion documentation. The HTML documentation is built using
# Doxygen, the Doxyfile for which is generated by CMake. The
# output of this is then deployed to the repository domain
# using github-pages-deploy-action.

          # looks disgusting. This binary is at version 1.9.5.
