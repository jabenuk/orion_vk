A low-level Vulkan graphics library for C that aims to abstract the more explicit aspects
of the Vulkan API without losing any functionality.

## Documentation

For library documentation, see the [GitHub pages deployment](https://jabenuk.github.io/orion_vk/).
Due to being very early in development, this documentation  is **_very_ subject to change**.
